This is a Chrome Extension. Just select words or sentence, and there will be a popup showing all kinds of information. Have fun searching!
I finished all the hack within 24 hours, so don't expect too much with the decent of the code.

Already known bugs:
<s>1.Not working on Google related pages, not working on jQuery UI page.</s>
<s>2.Sometimes the trigger of the selection not work properly.</s>
3.Show Warnings in https pages "displayed insecure content";

Next steps:
<s>1.Use bootstrap as display framework;</s>
2.Finish option page;

Things need to be improved:
1.Extend Wiki in the popup;
2.Play video directly;
3.Show pictures directly;
<s>4.Display the popup within the window;</s>
5.Add config code, so the option page can be configable.

Future Functions:
1.Option page;
2.Provide more search engines;
3.Provide a way to choose preferred search engines;
4.Provide more selections to trigger the search;
5.Option of max selected charaters num;
6.International access;
