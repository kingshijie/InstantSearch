This is a Chrome Extension. Just select words or sentence, and there will be a popup showing all kinds of information. Have fun searching!
I finished all the hack within 24 hours, so don't expect too much with the decent of the code.

Already known bugs:
1.Not working on Google related pages, not working on jQuery UI page.
2.Sometimes the trigger of the selection not work properly.

Functions next:
1.Option page;
2.Provide more search engines;

5.Option of max selected charaters num;
6.International access;
